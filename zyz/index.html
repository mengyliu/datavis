				There is a large amount of data that people have witnessed UFOs, through ancient times and modern days. But still, do you believe in UFO and aliens? In 2019, we had the opportunity to dig deeper into over 80,000 sighting reports data. Based on our understanding of the UFO sighting phenomena, there are factors: external events, population, daily/seasonal activity, and time of day.

					The second chat shows a map which represents the geological relationship between the number of UFO sighting in the states of the United States with the population and air force locations. 
					Whenever we pulled out a list of the top states for UFO sightings, our first instinct was that the reason California is No. 1 because of its population. However, after exploring the other top 10 states, we found vast contrast: 

					For example, in 2010, Washington has about half the population (6.7 million) of Pennsylvania (12.7 million), but Washington (247) has nearly twice of the UFO sighting numbers of Pennsylvania’s (145). In the meantime, New York (19.4 million), who has nearly population of Washington and Pennsylvania combined, has UFO sighting volumes (160) similar to Pennsylvania. So population isn’t the sole driver.

					The opinion that a state’s population is the sole driver for the volume of UFO sighting reports doesn’t hold up.

					We then looked at the relationship between UFO sightings and air force locations.
